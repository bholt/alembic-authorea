# Required Revisions

> Expand the related work discussion to cover the areas raised by the reviewers (especially reviewer A).

Some of the original *Background* section has been moved to a later *Related Work* section which has been filled out with references to many of the suggestions by the reviewers.

> Improve the writing in Section 4 (presentation of the algorithm). Possibly include a more carefully worked out example to illustrate it.

Some clarifying examples and explanations have been added to Section 4 ("Alembic analysis"). Section 4.2,  paragraph 2 now explains why regions may not overlap, and the possibility of duplicating instructions is intentionally not considered.
