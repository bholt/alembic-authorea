## Reviewer B

> In the computation of the cost heuristic, how do you account for subtype polymorphism? ...

Added the last paragraph in Section 4.2.2 to address this.

> You should take a look at systems like ParalleX and SWARM currently under development as part of the Dept. of Energy's X-Stack project and discuss the relationship between Alembic/Grappa and those systems.

Added ParalleX to related work (6.1).

> All of your code listings & figures don't come out well on black & white (for example none of the highlighted blocks which are critical to the points you are trying to make are visible at all).

Colors have been adjusted to be more black and white friendly, and additional distinction is made on code highlights with borders.
