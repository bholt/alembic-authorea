## Reviewer C

> It might be interesting to include a discussion of whether or not this sort of analysis would be any more difficult in other PGAS languages/runtimes.

A mention of how this would be enhanced by information from Chapel is in section 4.1.

> I was a bit confused by the comment in 4.1 that anchor points with no information about the region of memory they access must be conservatively associated with the enclosing task's home locale.

Added a clearer explanation of this in the penultimate paragraph in 4.1.
